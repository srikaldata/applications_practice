Create a command-line to-do list application.
Creating a command-line to-do list application is a fantastic way to practice Python programming and work with basic data management. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to building this application, including game steps, input ideas, and additional features:

Game Steps (Workflow)
Introduction:
+ Start with a welcome message and brief instructions on how to use the application.
+ Explain the available commands and how to perform actions like adding, removing, and viewing tasks.

Main Menu:
+ Present a main menu with options for different actions:
+ Add a task
+ View all tasks
+ Mark a task as complete
+ Remove a task
+ Exit the application

Task Management:
* Implement functionality to add, view, update, and remove tasks.
* Store tasks with details such as title, description, and completion status.

Data Persistence:
* Save tasks to a file or database so that they persist between sessions.
* Load tasks from the file/database when the application starts.

User Interaction:
* Use input prompts to interact with the user and execute their commands.
* Provide feedback and confirmation messages for actions taken.

Exit and Save:
* Save the current state of tasks when the user exits the application.
* Confirm that tasks are saved and provide an exit message.

Input Ideas
Command Input:
* Use text commands to navigate the menu and perform actions (e.g., add, view, complete, remove, exit).

Task Details:
* For adding tasks, prompt the user for details like title and description.
* Use input fields for the task details:
* Title: Enter task title:
* Description: Enter task description:

Task Identification:
* Use a unique identifier (like a number) or task title to reference tasks for actions such as marking complete or removing.

Confirmation:
* Prompt the user to confirm actions such as removing a task or marking it as complete.

Additional Features
Task Prioritization:
* Allow users to set priorities (e.g., low, medium, high) for tasks.
* Implement sorting or filtering by priority.

Due Dates:
* Add due dates to tasks and provide options to view tasks by date or sort by due date.

Search and Filter:
* Implement search functionality to find tasks by title or description.
* Add filters to view tasks by status (e.g., completed, pending) or priority.

Task Categories:
* Allow users to categorize tasks into different groups or projects.

Export and Import:
* Provide options to export tasks to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) and import tasks from a file.

User Authentication:
* Add user authentication if multiple users need to manage their own tasks.

Reminders and Notifications:
* Implement reminders or notifications for tasks with upcoming due dates.

Statistics:
* Show statistics such as the number of completed tasks, pending tasks, or tasks by priority.
