Building a Number-Guessing Game in Python
Building a number-guessing game in Python is a great way to practice control flow, user input, and random number generation. Below are some input ideas and the steps to implement this game.

Game Steps
1. Welcome Message
Display a welcome message and explain the game rules to the user.

2. Random Number Generation
Generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).

3. User Input
Prompt the user to guess the number.

4. Feedback
Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

5. Repeat
Allow the user to guess again until they find the correct number.

6. End Game
Congratulate the user and display the number of attempts taken.


Input Ideas:
Here are some specific inputs you can use to enhance the game:

* Range of Numbers
Allow the user to choose the range (e.g., 1 to 50, 1 to 100, or 1 to 1000) to adjust the difficulty.

* Maximum Attempts
Set a limit on the number of attempts (e.g., 5 or 10 attempts) to increase the challenge.

* Hints
Provide hints after a certain number of wrong guesses, such as whether the number is even or odd.

* Difficulty Levels
Offer different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) that affect the range of numbers and the number of attempts allowed.

* Play Again Option
After the game ends, ask if the user wants to play again.

* Input Validation
Ensure the user inputs a valid number within the specified range.


Additional Features:
* Scoring System
Introduce a scoring system based on the number of attempts.

*Leaderboard
Track and display the top scores or fastest guesses.

* Graphical Interface
Use a library like Tkinter to create a GUI version of the game.
